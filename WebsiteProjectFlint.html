    <h3>I have learned many things.</h3>
    <p>
        The two pictures above shows the difference between many of the pipelines in the united states comared to the problem in Flint,Michigan.
		The first images shows pipelines lined with orthophophates, a commom form of preventive corriosin of lead pipes, being used in a nornaml neighborhood.
		However, in the second image there is nothing stoping the water from rusting and corroding the pipelines, thus allowing the lead to follow freely in the Flint water system.

        I'm now completing my first project using my new-found knowledge and skills!

    <h2>I can't wait to learn CSS!</h2>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be of great use when learning to lay out and format the look of my web page.  I am looking forward to learning this and many other things as I continue in the Exploring STEM Careers Pipeline Program!
